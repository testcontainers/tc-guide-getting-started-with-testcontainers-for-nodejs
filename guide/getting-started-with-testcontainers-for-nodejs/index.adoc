Testcontainers is a testing library that provides easy and lightweight APIs for
bootstrapping integration tests with real services wrapped in Docker
containers. Using Testcontainers, you can write tests that talk to the same
type of services you use in production, without mocks or in-memory services.

[NOTE]
If you are new to Testcontainers, please read
https://testcontainers.com/guides/introducing-testcontainers[What is
Testcontainers, and why should you use it?] to learn more about it.

Let us look at how we can use Testcontainers to test a Node.js application using a
PostgreSQL database.

== Create a new project

Initialize a new Node.js project using the `npm init` command:

[source,bash]
----
npm init -y
----

Add `pg`, `jest` and `@testcontainers/postgresql` as dependencies:

[source,bash]
----
npm install pg --save
npm install jest @testcontainers/postgresql --save-dev
----

== Write the tests and solution

Let us create a simple application that stores and retrieves customers from a PostgreSQL database.

Test driven development (TDD) is a great way to develop software, and coupled with Testcontainers we can quickly iterate to get working solutions with confidence. Let's write our first test which saves and returns customers from PostgreSQL:

[source%nowrap,javascript]
----
include::{codebase}/src/src/customer-repository.test.js[]
----

The `beforeAll` block sets up a _actual_ PostgreSQL container. We then initialize a client from the `pg` library, and connect it to the PostgreSQL instance running in the container. As part of the test setup, we create the `customer` table.

Now, let's implement a solution:

[source%nowrap,javascript]
----
include::{codebase}/src/src/customer-repository.js[]
----

Looks good, but does it work?

[source%nowrap,bash]
----
$ npm test

> tc-guide-getting-started-with-testcontainers-for-nodejs@1.0.0 test

 PASS  src/customer-repository.test.js
  Customer Repository
    âœ“ should create and return multiple customers (5 ms)

Test Suites: 1 passed, 1 total
Tests:       1 passed, 1 total
Snapshots:   0 total
Time:        2.11 s, estimated 3 s
Ran all test suites.
----

Voila! You have your first Testcontainers based test running.

Are you seeing the benefit of testing with a real PostgreSQL instance? If not, try changing the `id` type of the `customer` table from `INT` to `BIGINT` and re-run the test, what would you expect to happen? If you had a unit test, or used a mock instead of using Testcontainers, you would _not_ have caught this bug.

Sometimes it's useful to see what Testcontainers is doing under the hood. Did we really spin up a container? What version did we use? What's PostgreSQL doing? You can see all this and more by setting the `DEBUG` environment variable. Let's re-run the test with `DEBUG=testcontainers*` and find out:

[source%nowrap,bash]

== Conclusion

We have explored how to use Testcontainers for Node.js to test an application using a PostgreSQL database.

We have seen how writing an integration test using Testcontainers is very
similar to writing a unit test that you can run from your IDE. Also, any of
your teammates can clone the project and run tests without installing Postgres
on their computers.

In addition to PostgreSQL, Testcontainers provides dedicated
https://github.com/testcontainers/testcontainers-node/tree/main/packages/modules[modules] for many commonly used
SQL databases, NoSQL databases, messaging queues, etc. Besides the modules you can use Testcontainers to run any containerized dependency for your tests!

You can explore more about Testcontainers at https://testcontainers.com/.
